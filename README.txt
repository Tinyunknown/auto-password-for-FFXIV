Hello! This is a small little script I made with pyqutogui that automatically
signs you into Final Fantasy 14 Online if your to lazy(like I am) to input your
password.

If the program doesn't work, make sure you have the script and the images in the same
folder. you might also need pyautogui and pillow installed. You also might need to
move the FFXIV window so your command prompt doesn't cover it.

I have also included a .exe file of the script that, hopefully, will make it so you
don't need the modules installed.
