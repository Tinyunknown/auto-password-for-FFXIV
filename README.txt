Hello! This is a small little script I made with pyqutogui that automatically
signs you into Final Fantasy 14 Online if your to lazy(like I am) to input your
password.

To use this script, you need to change the password variable in the .py file. You can do this by opening the file in your favorite IDE and typeing your password there.

If the program doesn't work, make sure you have the script and the images in the same
folder. you might also need pyautogui and pillow installed. You also might need to
move the FFXIV window so your command prompt doesn't cover it.
